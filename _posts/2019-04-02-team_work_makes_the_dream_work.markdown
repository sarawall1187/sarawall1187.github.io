How building my first Sinatra app, unexpectedly, taught me to love pair programming.

When you're a student in a web development bootcamp, there's a rollercoaster of learning, information, and emotions that they literally tell you about when you start. Sometimes you are high on a working, debugged mountain of success. Other times you are trudging through the trenches of desperation, panic, and brokeness. 

Skip to building your first MVC app, all on your own, from scratch. When I first started this project I was exhilirated with new ideas and plans to make a brilliant program that I was sure to create with ease. Then all of a sudden I'm several days in, I'm feeling like I'm lost in my own program and every line looks the same. Thats when I threw out the lifeline. I needed fresh eyes. Even though I knew every line of code like the back of my hand, I couldn't see the problems. 

I love the resources and support that Flatiron School provides. I hopped on Slack, posted in the Sinatra channel, and within minutes two students and an instructor were replying with help. I was able to set up two different screen shares with one student who really knew her stuff! She taught me some things that hadn't quite sunk in while going over the curriculum. Another student cloned my repo when he had free time and gave me an awesome "punch list", if you will, of some final bugs and user experience touches to make my program really nice and smooth. My instructor got my program from broken to working again over chat - all while talking me off the ledge of despair. 

Now I am finishing up and even feeling confident enough to go the extra mile with some nice styling finishes, as well as, attempting the challenge of adding error messages using the flash method to my program. Don't get me wrong- I learned a ton about coding, best practices, and industry conventions during this project. But what stuck out the most was how much I needed help and I got it. I believe web development is a team effort and a lot more fun with others to celebrate the wins with you!
