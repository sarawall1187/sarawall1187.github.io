	 There are several answers to why I wanted to start a career in web development, but I will start with the first answer that comes to mind:** because it sounds cool!** I can't wait to get my first job and when people ask, "What do you do for a living?", I can be like, "Oh you know, nothing much, just computer programming." I enjoy the thought of all the different titles offered at different jobs.

	 Another reason I wanted to learn to code is the challenge it offers. Anything worth doing isn't going to be easy, in my opinion. And then as soon as you think you've mastered a language, there's a new programming language out that is newer and more exciting than the last.  It takes thought, dedication, technique, and willingness to collaborate to code. 

	 Speaking of collaboration, I also enjoy the teamwork aspect of developing. I look forward, and hope, my first job will offer a team enviroment with knowledgable, more experienced programmers than myself. My learning curve will be through the roof when working hands-on along side of professionals everyday. 

	 Truth is, I learn new reasons all the time of why I am glad I decided to take this journey. This community offers support, guidance, and freely shared information. I enjoy being challenged to think and problem solve. I look at everyday things now completely different. I am glad I joined this world and hope I make a lot of new developer friends along the way!
