I was not ready for this project. This list of requirements seemed daunting and I wasn't sure I remembered half of what they were asking us to do. The scope method? No one remembers how to write a scope method. Also the relationships requirements for our models about made my eyes cross. 

But here I am now on the other side of this, and I can't believe I finished. I solidified my knowledge of routing to views, how models interact with each other based on their relationships, and learned a few new tricks. For example, instead of Bootstrap to style my project, I learned about Materialize, Google's version of Bootstrap. Its ok. Not extremely well documented but I am hoping will show diversity. Also there's is a handy helper method called .ordinalize that will take your integer and and the "st", "th", or "rd" for you. SO helpful. I did remember how to use a scope method after all. And the coolest part was implementing OmniAuth for Facebook login. That feels like real developer stuff.

I definitely felt the pressure when I started this project but with careful planning and making sure I was 100% on board with what I wanted from my models, the application came along pretty smoothly and I feel excited to turn it in. I love coding more with everything I learn.
